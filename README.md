#easyLinearStepper.h
a library for controlling linear stepper actuators with an Arduino

acceleration and max speed are hard coded.

#####TO DO
    - [ ]arduino library package and code examples
    - [x] move function base on x distance instead of steps
    - [ ]select accelaration function, max speed
    - [ ]control multiple stepper drivers at the same time with diferent speeds
    - [ ]speed depending on position

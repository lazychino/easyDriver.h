#easyLinearStepper.h
a library for controlling linear stepper actuators with an Arduino

acceleration and max speed are hard coded.

#####TO DO
- [x] arduino library package
- [x] move function base on x distance instead of steps
- [ ] accelaration function, max speed
- [ ] control multiple stepper drivers at the same time with diferent speeds
- [ ] code examples
